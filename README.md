# JavaFX Chat Room System

**Course:** CSCI 400 â€“ Advanced Applications Development  
**Semester:** Spring 2025  
**Instructor:** Prof. Alec Berenbaum  

A lightweight multi-user chat application written in Java 11 with JavaFX 17.  
The project is split into two GUI programs:

* **ChatServer** â€“ listens on **TCP 5000**, shows connected users, and broadcasts chat lines.  
* **ChatClient** â€“ lets a user connect, send messages, and disconnect gracefully.

##  Features

| Category | Server | Client |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **GUI** | `ListView` of usernames; buttons **Drop Selected**, **Drop All**, **Exit** | Username / IP / Port fields; read-only log; enter-to-send text field; **Connect**, **Disconnect**, **Exit** |
| **Networking** | One **acceptor** thread + one `ClientHandler` thread per connection | Reader thread keeps UI responsive |
| **Broadcasts** | `[username]: message` fan-out to every client | Displays incoming lines instantly |
| **Kick control** | Drop one user or everyone | Auto-re-enable **Connect** after disconnect |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **JDK 11** (or newer)  
* **JavaFX SDK 17** (added to Module Path)  
* Eclipse 2021-09 or later â€“ any IDE works if JavaFX is configured

### Build & Run

1. **Run the server**  
   *Import* the **ChatServer** project â†’ **Run As â€º Java Application**.  
2. **Run one or more clients**  
   *Import* **ChatClient** â†’ run `Main.java` (open multiple instances if desired).  
3. In each client window:  
   * Username â†’ any name  
   * IP â†’ `localhost`  
   * Port â†’ `5000`  
   * Click **Connect**, then type messages and press **Enter**.  
4. Server-side buttons: **Drop Selected**, **Drop All**, **Exit**.

## Wire Protocol

CLIENT â†’ <username>\n
SERVER â†’ <username> has joined the chat\n
CLIENT â†’ free-form chat line\n
â€¦repeatâ€¦

(disconnect)
SERVER â†’ <username> has left the chat\n

All messages are plain text with a single newline terminator, so Telnet/netcat can be used for quick testing.

##  Threading Model

* **Server**  
  * **Acceptor Thread** â€“ loops on `ServerSocket.accept()`  
  * **ClientHandler Thread** â€“ per client, handles blocking I/O  
  * UI updates marshalled with `Platform.runLater()`  
* **Client**  
  * **Reader Thread** â€“ blocks on `BufferedReader.readLine()`  
  * JavaFX Application Thread handles user input & outbound writes
